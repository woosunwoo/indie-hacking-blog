# 🔔 Upwork Alerts Chrome Extension  

---

## 📝 Overview  
A simple Chrome extension that helps freelancers respond to Upwork jobs faster by sending desktop notifications every few minutes.  

Built in a weekend. Shipped fast. 🚢  

---

## ⚡ The problem  
On Upwork, being among the first to apply greatly increases your chances of landing a contract.  

I was constantly missing opportunities because I saw jobs too late. 🕐  

---

## 🛠️ The solution  
I built a Chrome extension that pings me with notifications whenever new jobs appear.  

Now I can be one of the first to apply without refreshing the site all day. 🔄  

Simple. Effective.  

---

## 🎯 The launch  
I listed the tool on Gumroad as a **$5 lifetime deal**. 💵  

No fancy launch. No ads. Just a small experiment to see if other freelancers feel the same pain.

## 📚 Learnings  
- **Scratch your own itch.** If it works for you, it’ll likely work for others. ✨  
- **Ship small and fast.** A weekend hack > waiting forever for a “big idea.” ⏳  
- **Micro-products matter.** Each one builds momentum and opens doors. 🚪

## 🌱 The bigger picture  
This isn’t about building the next unicorn. 🦄  

It’s about building, shipping, and stacking small wins.  

One project at a time. 🧩
