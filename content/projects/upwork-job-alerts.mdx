# Upwork Alerts Chrome Extension  

## Overview  
A simple Chrome extension that helps freelancers respond to Upwork jobs faster by sending desktop notifications every few minutes.  

## Problem  
On Upwork, being among the first to apply greatly increases your chances of landing a contract. I was constantly missing opportunities because I saw jobs too late.  

## Solution  
I built a Chrome extension that pings me with notifications whenever new jobs appear. This way, I can be one of the first to apply without manually refreshing the site all day.  

## Launch  
I listed the tool on Gumroad as a **$5 lifetime deal**. No fancy launch or marketing ‚Äî just a small experiment to see if other freelancers have the same pain.

## Learnings  
- Scratching your own itch is often the best way to start.  
- Shipping small projects quickly is more valuable than waiting for a ‚Äúbig idea.‚Äù  
- Even micro-products can create momentum and open doors.
