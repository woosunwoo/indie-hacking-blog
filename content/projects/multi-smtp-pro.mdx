## 🪦 Old but not dead  

I found an old gem called `multi_smtp`. Last update? **2014.**  

It worked… kinda. But only on old Rails versions. And it lacked something I really needed: a way to spread email load across multiple providers.  

Why? Because free tiers exist. And if you rotate them properly, you can send **a lot** of emails without ever pulling out your credit card.

## 🧙 The GPT-5 hack  

I’ll be honest: I didn’t want to read 11 years of outdated Ruby code.  

So I asked GPT-5 to help me upgrade it.  

- Updated it for Rails 8 (works cleanly now)  
- Added **round robin delivery**: Active loop through every provider you configure, distributing the load evenly  

Now you can stack Gmail, Resend, SendGrid, Mailgun—whatever free tiers you have. Emails spread out, limits avoided.  

Unlimited emails. $0 spent. 💸📧🤖

## ⚙️ How it works  

1. List your SMTP providers
2. Choose **round_robin** as the delivery mode
3. Every email cycles to the next provider automatically
