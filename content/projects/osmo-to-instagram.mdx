# 📱 Upload your DJI Osmo Pocket 3 videos to Instagram in seconds  

**Stop re-encoding. Start sharing.** ✨

👉 **Solopreneur update**  
- 🚀 Shipped a tiny tool this week  
- 🛠️ Built with **Rails + Next.js**  
- 🎥 Fixes a pain I’ve had for months

## 😩 The problem  

If you’ve ever filmed a vertical video with the **DJI Osmo Pocket 3**, you know the pain:  
- ❌ Instagram doesn’t recognize it as a Reel or Story  
- ⌛ You have to re-encode with some weird FFmpeg command or converter
- 😤 Or worse—you upload, and Instagram crops or rejects it  

That friction kills the magic. You’re ready to post *now*, not spend 30 minutes fixing file formats.

## 🪄 The tiny fix  

So I built **Osmo to Instagram**.  

It’s dead simple:  
1. 📤 Upload your Osmo video  
2. ⏳ Wait a few seconds  
3. 📥 Download a file Instagram *immediately* recognizes as a native Reel or Story  

No settings. No tech jargon. Just shoot → upload → post.

## 💡 Why this matters  

Every time there’s friction in creating content, most people stop.  

Creators don’t need *more* tools. They need tools that *disappear*.  
That’s the spirit behind this project: remove the technical barrier so you can focus on sharing your story.

## ⚙️ How I built it  

- 🐙 **Rails**: backend API + file processing
- ⚡ **Next.js**: clean upload UI, instant feedback
- 🎬 **FFmpeg**: does the heavy lifting (hidden from the user)

It’s rough but working. The important thing is: **it ships**. 🚢

---

## 🔮 What’s next

- 🖱️ Drag-and-drop batch uploads
- 📲 One-click “send to phone” link
- 🎙️ Maybe even auto-captions for Reels

If you use the DJI Osmo Pocket 3 and struggle with Instagram uploads, I’d love for you to try it.
