## ⚡ The problem

On Upwork, speed matters.  

The first few proposals usually get the client’s attention.  

I was always late. 🕐  

---

## 😫 The frustration

By the time I saw a job, ten other freelancers had already applied.  

I felt like I was always one step behind. 🐢  

---

## 🛠️ The hack

So I built my own solution.  

A Chrome extension that pings me with a notification every few minutes when new jobs appear.  

Simple. Effective. Cheating! 😅  

---

## 🧪 The experiment

Then I asked myself: *if it helps me, could it help others?*  

So I listed it on Gumroad.  

**$5. Lifetime deal. 💵**  

👉 [Get the extension on Gumroad →](https://sunwooy.gumroad.com/l/upworkalerts)  

No big plan. Just a test. 🎯

## 📊 The results (so far)

It’s still early.  

Not viral. Not thousands of dollars.  

But it works.  

And that’s the point. ✅

## 📝 What I learned

- **Scratching your own itch works.** If you need it, others probably do too. ✨  
- **You don’t need a “startup.”** A weekend hack and a Gumroad link are enough. 🛒  
- **Small bets compound.** Each one makes you better, faster, bolder. 📈

## 🌱 The bigger picture

Indie hacking isn’t about unicorns. 🦄  

It’s about momentum. 🌀  

It’s about stacking small wins, one tool at a time. 🧩
