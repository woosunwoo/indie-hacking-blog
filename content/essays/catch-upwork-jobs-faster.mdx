## The problem

On Upwork, speed matters.

The first few proposals usually get the client’s attention.

I was always late.

---

## The frustration

By the time I saw a job, ten other freelancers had already applied.

I felt like I was always one step behind.

---

## The hack

So I built my own solution.

A Chrome extension that pings me with a notification every few minutes when new jobs appear.

Simple. Effective. Cheating!

---

## The experiment

Then I asked myself: *if it helps me, could it help others?*

So I listed it on Gumroad.

**$5. Lifetime deal.**

No big plan. Just a test.

## The results (so far)

It’s still early.

Not viral. Not thousands of dollars.

But it works.

And that’s the point.

---

## What I learned

- **Scratching your own itch works.** If you need it, others probably do too.
- **You don’t need a “startup.”** A weekend hack and a Gumroad link are enough.
- **Small bets compound.** Each one makes you better, faster, bolder.

## The bigger picture

Indie hacking isn’t about unicorns.

It’s about momentum.

It’s about stacking small wins, one tool at a time.
